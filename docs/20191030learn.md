# Play with gulp
* Tip: Markdow preview on VS Code **Ctrl+Shift+V**

I used first gulp when i play with Sharepoint Online, and wonder what it is, what it can do?
From [Gulp Offical](https://gulpjs.com/)
> gulp is a toolkit for automating painful or time-consuming tasks in your development workflow, so you can stop messing around and build something.
So i mean Gulp is task runner.

## Install gulp command line utility

``` bash
npm install --global gulp-cli
```
## Create a project directory and navigate into it

``` bash
# npx for excute
# npm for install
npx mkdirp my-project
cd my-project
```
## Create a package.json file in your project directory

``` bash
npm init
```
## Install the gulp package in your devDependencies

``` bash
npm install --save-dev gulp
echo "// init gulp file" > gulpfile.js
```
## write first task
``` js
function defaultTask(cb) {
  // place code for your default task here
  cb();
}

exports.default = defaultTask
```
## Run gulp
``` bashs
gulp
```
